;; this analysis tracks the first and last uses of wires in a program in order to make other data flow analyses more efficient.
;;; We create a map of this information and hand it to the other analyses so they don't have to track variables and keep copying them over (which slows down the analysis significantly). 

;;; rule: if a wire is dead at an "elimination point" past its final use, then it can be removed from the const and faint information. for consts, the final use is in the forward direction. for faints, the final use is in the backwards direction.
