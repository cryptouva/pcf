;;; this analysis tracks the uses of constants through a program to determine if we can eliminate some gates by propagating constants and to help with other dataflow analyses
;;; A variable x e Var has a constant value c e Const at a program point u if for every path reaching u along which a definition of x reaches u, the value of x is c.

;;; f_n(x) = (x-Kill_n(x) Union Gen_n

;;; Constant propagation is forward data flow problem
;;; we represent the constants available at a program point as a map from variable to constant. if the variable is not a constant, we exclude it from the map (this is a memory consideration)
;;; the confluence operation is defined in terms of applying conf-hat on pairs of the same variable
;; ForAll x1,x2 e L, x1 conf x2 = { <z, dx conf-hat dy > | <z,dx> e x1, <z,dy> e x2, x e Var }
;; our analysis will merge maps of constant values by taking all of the key-value pairs that are common to both maps and all of the key-value pairs for which the keys are unique to one map. Pairs from two maps with the same key but different values will be discarded.
;; Our hmap-intersect operation uses the same idea, but takes only the key-value pairs that the maps have in common, discarding everything else.

;;; Gen_n(x) = ConstGen_n Union DepGen_n(x)
;;; Kill_n(x) = ConstKill_n Union DepKill_n(x)

;;; in general, Gen and Kill for constant propagation are:
;;;
;;; In_n = { BI                          n is Start
;;;          Meet (p in pred(n)) Out_p   Otw
;;; Out_n = f_n(In_n)
;;; (remember, Out_n is passed to the next block, In_n is an input to this block)

;;; ConstGen_n = { {<x,eval(e,Top)>}  n is assignment x=e, Opd(e) subset Const 
;;;                **{<x,bottom-hat>} n is read(x) ;; read is always alice() or bob()
;;;                /0  otw
;;; DepGen_n(x) = { <x,d>    n is assignment x=e, <x,d> e *x*
;;;                  \0      otw
;;;

;;; ConstKill_n    =  **/0
;;; DepKill_n(x)   = { {<x,d>} n is assignment x=e, <x,d> e *x*
;;;                    {<x,d>} n is read(x), <x,d> e *x*
;;;                     /0                otw
;;; explanation:

;;; val(e,x) = { c if e is c e Const
;;;              d if e is x e Car, <x,d> e *x*
;;;

;;; **because read(x) is a way for us to input non-consts, we move <x,bottom-hat> from ConstGen to ConstKill

;; all unassigned wires are 0, so if something is not found in the consts then it is implicitly 0 (otherwise it will be an integer or pcf2-block-graph:pcf-not-const)
